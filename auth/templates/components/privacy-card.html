The legal bases for Ascending creations processing of personal data are primarily that the processing is necessary for the Service to function correctly, which are further explained in the section “How We Use the Information We Collect” of this Policy. We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate.</p>
                <p><b>2.1 User-provided Information. </b></p>
                <p>When you use the Service, as a User or as a Visitor, you may provide, and we may collect Personal Data. Examples of Personal Data include username, display name, name, email address, and mailing address. Personal Data also includes other information, such as geographic area or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service.

                <p><b>2.2 Required Information for Accounts.</b></p>
                <p>Though you may Give us permission to store your Personal Data, we do require some Personal Data for the forum to function correctly as to its fullest. Due to this you will not be able to register an account Unless you Allow us to store your Username, Display Name, and Email address. This information is crucial for the Service to function correctly and is needed to administer the Service. Your Username will only be visible by administrators and only used to log you into your Account. Your email will be used for an alternative log in, to send a registration key for account verification, and to email you news or privacy and terms of service updates if you click to receive such news and updates. The display name is publicly viewable by Visitor and Users of the Forum. It is used to identify the information you have given to the public and used for private messaging.  </p>
                <p><b>2.3 “Automatically Collected" Information. </b></p>
                <p>When a User or Visitor uses the Service, we may automatically record certain information from the User’s or Visitor’s device to create server-side cookies. This “automatically collected" information may include IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the Service. This information is only used to generate a Session ID, which can not easily point back to the user without first having the information above to recreate the session ID.</p>

                <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.
                However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us at privacy@ascendingcreations.com .
                If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.</p>

                <p>We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:
                •	the contents of closed and or banned accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure or ban;
                •	backups are kept for 3 months;</p>
                <p><b>10. Settings</b></p>
                <p>Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>
                <p><b>11. Data Transfer</b></p>
                <p>We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Service in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S or other countries. The U.S.  or other countries may not have the same data protection <p>framework as the country from which you may be using the Service. When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S. or other countries, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.
